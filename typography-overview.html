            <h1>Gaining a Better Understanding of Typography</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">An exploration of letterform anatomy and structural guidelines.</p>
        </header>

        <section>
            <p>
                Typography goes beyond merely picking a visually appealing font; it serves as the foundational structure of language. Each letterform is thoughtfully designed, and gaining a solid understanding of its anatomy can significantly enhance the work of designers, educators, and communicators.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let’s look at the essential elements that shape the way type functions on the page. Understanding these structural guidelines can significantly enhance your typographic design.

        <section class="highlight">
            <h2>Structural Guidelines</h2>
            <ul class="anatomy-list">
                <li><strong>Baseline:</strong> The invisible anchor that ensures consistent alignment within a line of text, providing a reliable reference point for all characters.</li>
                <li><strong>X-Height:</strong> Based on the height of the lowercase “x,” this measurement influences readability, particularly in small body text.</li>
                <li><strong>Cap Height:</strong> The indicator denoting the top of uppercase letters, measured from the baseline.</li>
                <li><strong>Ascender Line:</strong> Defines the upper boundary for parts of lowercase letters (like “b” and “d”) that extend beyond the x-height.</li>
                <li><strong>Descender Line:</strong> Establishes the lower boundary for strokes that dip below the baseline, as seen in letters like “g” and “p.”</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Stroke Anatomy</h2>
            <ul class="anatomy-list">
                <li><strong>Stem:</strong> The primary vertical or diagonal stroke in a letterform, providing structural integrity similar to a column.</li>
                <li><strong>Arm:</strong> A horizontal or upward-slanting stroke that does not connect at one end (e.g., “E” or “T”).</li>
                <li><strong>Loop:</strong> A closed or partially closed counter located at the bottom of letters like “g.”</li>
                <li><strong>Terminal:</strong> The end of a stroke that lacks a serif, adding personality and rhythm to the typeface.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Serif and Style Details</h2>
            <ul class="anatomy-list">
                <li><strong>Serif:</strong> Small projections at the ends of strokes that help guide the eye along lines of text, traditionally preferred for print readability.</li>
                <li><strong>Bracket:</strong> The curved connection between a serif and the primary stroke, contributing to the typeface’s classic or modern feel.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="highlight">
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Typography isn’t just decoration—it’s communication. Each of these elements affects how we perceive and process written language. Whether you're setting type for a medical journal or a prosthetics training module, these nuances shape how your message is received.

    <h2>Design Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Starting this project was particularly challenging because my Adobe Photoshop froze and wouldn’t allow me to open a new project. I attempted several solutions, including shutting down my computer, ending the Photoshop task, and even uninstalling and reinstalling the software, but none worked. After several hours of troubleshooting, I decided to open a course assignment I had previously completed while designing a postcard. I deleted the layers from that project and used the file as the foundation for my new magazine cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin, I adjusted the canvas size to 21 x 29.7 cm with a resolution of 300, which is the recommended size for a magazine cover. I utilized guides to ensure that my design remained within the working space. I selected a photo I had previously used in another project and, as a novice, I experimented with the hues, curves, brightness, and neural filters, choosing the colors I found most appealing.
    </p>

      Next, I researched fonts commonly used for magazine covers and decided to use Soltis Serif for the title. I experimented with different color variations and effects, such as beveling, embossing, shadows, and color overlays. For the remaining text, I chose Gil Sans, the font I had previously used in my earlier designs. To enhance the main message of the cover, I applied effects like drop shadows, giving the text a more three-dimensional appearance.
    </p>

      If this were a project for a company, I would include more details regarding the content of the magazine. However, I would avoid adding excessive text, as this can make the cover appear cluttered. Covers of research or medical magazines are often designed to be thought-provoking.
